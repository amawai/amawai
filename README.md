## Hello there 🐶 


I'm Amanda!


I'm currently a software engineer at Github :octocat: (unrelated, but I absolutely **love** octocat stickers). I also apparently enjoy writing lists prefixed with a variety of emojis.


👩‍💻&nbsp; Into web development but interested in learning in all aspects of the software world

🍜&nbsp; I enjoy noodling around in Javascript (React, Typescript), Python, Java

🤿&nbsp; I'm currently diving into Ruby and Ruby on Rails

✨&nbsp; Readable, clean code is my jam

On a more personal note, here are some other facts about me


🐵&nbsp; Super curious about almost anything

🥘&nbsp; Culinary adventures are the best adventures 

🌳&nbsp; Big believer in sustainability practices

🕹️&nbsp; I love pokemon!
