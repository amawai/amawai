## Hello there 🐶 


I'm Amanda!


I'm currently a software engineer at Github :octocat: (unrelated, but I absolutely **love** octocat stickers). I also apparently enjoy writing lists prefixed with a variety of emojis.


👩‍💻 Into web development but interested in learning in all aspects of the software world

🍜 I enjoy noodling around in Javascript (React, Typescript), Python, Java

🤿 I'm currently diving into Ruby and Ruby on Rails

✨ Readable, clean code is my jam

On a more personal note, here are some other facts about me


🐵 Super curious about other people's life experiences, traveling, science

🥘 Culinary adventures are the best adventures 

🌳 Big believer in sustainability practices

🕹️ I love pokemon!
